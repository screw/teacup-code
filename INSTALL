OVERVIEW
--------

TEACUP assumes a testbed setup as described in the tech report: 
http://caia.swin.edu.au/reports/150210C/CAIA-TR-150210C.pdf

The testbed has two subnets that are separated by one router, with at 
least one host in each subnet acting as traffic source and/or sink. The 
hosts must run Linux, FreeBSD, Windows 7 or Mac OS X, and the router 
must run Linux (preferably) or FreeBSD.

Each host needs an extra network interface connected to a separate 
control network. Also, one needs a separate host (control host) that 
runs TEACUP to control the testbed hosts (experimental hosts) via 
the control network.

On the control host you need to install Python, the Python Fabric
toolkit and TEACUP. To run the analysis functions and produce graphs 
you also need to install R. The tool pdfjam is needed for some shell
scripts provided to combine multiple pdf graphs on one page. To plot
RTT graphs based on tcpdump files the SPP tool must be installed.

TEACUP also uses a number of tools that are usually installed by default 
on a FreeBSD, Mac OS X or Linux system, such as ping, kill and dd. We strongly 
recommend to run Linux or FreeBSD on the control host, as so far TEACUP 
has only been tested on FreeBSD or Linux.

TEACUP post-1.0 contains experimental animated playback functionality,
which requires additional packages installed on the control host as
described under ./animate/INSTALL-teaplot (and documented in
./docs/teaplot-docs.lyx)

On the experiment hosts you need to install several tools for traffic 
generation: a modified iperf, a modified httperf and a modified nttcp. 
Furthermore, you need to install software for the logging of TCP state
information. A number of these tools are supplied in source form under
./tools and described in http://caia.swin.edu.au/reports/150210C/CAIA-TR-150210C.pdf 

If you want to run experiments with Windows you need to install 
Cygwin with the following packages: cygrunsrv, openssh, wget, procps, 
psmisc, make, autoconf, automake, gcc, lighttpd, openssh, pcre-devel, 
patch. This will allow you to build the traffic generators, provide
SSH remote access TEACUP needs and also provide all other tools 
TEACUP needs. You can download Cygwin from https://www.cygwin.com/.
Follow the provided instructions to install it. Also this is described
in more detail in http://caia.swin.edu.au/reports/150210C/CAIA-TR-150210C.pdf 

TEACUP can use a multi-boot OS setup on the experimental hosts and reboot
the hosts into the desired OS automatically before starting experiments.
This requires a specific setup (including PXE booting) as described in
http://caia.swin.edu.au/reports/150210C/CAIA-TR-150210C.pdf. While
such a multi-boot OS setup is very useful, it is entirely optional.
TEACUP also works with hosts that only run a single OS. TEACUP can use 
power controllers to automatically power cycle hosts, but this is also 
an optional feature


INSTALL R AND PDFJAM
--------------------

These are needed on the control host for plotting graphs.

Install R using your package management tools or download R from
http://www.r-project.org/ and follow the installation instructions from
this web site.

The following R packages/libraries need to be installed (please refer
to the R manual on how to install R libraries)):
- ggplot2 (for analyse_2d_density)

Install pdfjam using your package management tools.


INSTALL SPP
-----------

SPP is needed on the control host to plot RTT figures.

SPP is a tool that computes RTT estimates based on tcpdump files collected
at both ends of a path. Download the latest version of SPP from
http://caia.swin.edu.au/tools/spp/ and follow the instructions
provided in the tarball to install it. 


INSTALL FABRIC
--------------

TEACUP is based on Fabric (hhtp://docs.fabfile.org).

Log in as root.

Install Python 2.7 with your package management tools. Python 2.6 may
work but is not recommended.

Install pip:

On FreeBSD you can use portmaster:
> portmaster devel/py-pip

On Linux use your package manager, e.g. on OpenSUSE you can use zypper:
> zypper install python-pip

Install Fabric:
> pip install fabric

Upgrade an existing Fabric:
> pip install --upgrade fabric

Test if Fabric works:
> fab --version
Fabric 1.8.0
Paramiko 1.12.0

If Fabric is installed correctly it will print out the version info as shown
above.


INSTALL OTHER REQUIRED PYTHON MODULES
-------------------------------------

TEACUP uses mostly standard modules that should be present if Python is 
installed. The following modules that TEACUP needs are possibly not part of 
a standard Python installation and need to be installed manually, 
for example with pip:
- pexpect (NOTE: version 3.2 works, version 3.3 does NOT work)


INSTALL TEACUP SCRIPTS 
----------------------

Unpack the archive:
> cd /home/user
> tar -xvzf teacup-<version>.tar.gz

This creates a directory /home/user/teacup-<version> with all the scripts,
which we will refer to as <teacup_dir> in the following examples.

Create a directory for an experiment:
> mkdir -p /home/user/experiment/

Each experiment needs a config.py script. Start with a copy of the example
config file, for example:

> cp <teacup_dir>/example_configs/config-scenario1.py /home/user/experiment/config.py

Also copy the run.sh file:

> cp <teacup_dir>/run.sh /home/user/experiment/

For convenience or if fabfile.py should be modified for an experiment it should 
also be copied:

> cp <teacup_dir>/fabfile.py /home/user/experiment/

Edit /home/user/experiment/config.py and change the TPCONF_script_path
variable at the top to point to <teacup_dir> (the location of the scripts,
e.g. /home/user/teacup-1.1)

Also modify TPCONF_router, TPCONF_hosts and TPCONF_host_internal_ip based on your
testbed hosts used for the experiment. Set env.user and env.password to the superuser
and superuser password used on all your testbed hosts.
 
Edit other experiment settings in /home/user/experiment/config.py as required.

Before running an actual experiment, you can check that the config file has 
no errors (this is also done automatically by TEACUP as first step though):

> fab check_config

Without fabfile.py in the experiment directory start an experiment like this:

> run.sh /home/user/teacup-1.1/fabfile.py

Or you can start an experiment with fab directly:

> PYTHONPATH=. fab -f /home/user/teacup-1.1/fabfile.py run_experiment_multiple

Instead of running a whole experiment one can run single tasks, e.g. to check
if all tools are installed on hosts 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3 run:

> PYTHONPATH=. fab -f /home/user/teacup-1.1/fabfile.py -H 192.168.1.2,192.168.1.3 check_host

To see the list of available tasks, run:

> fab -f /home/user/teacup-1.1/fabfile.py -l

With fabfile.py in the experiment directory we don't need to specify the path. The above
commands simplify to:

> run.sh
> fab run_experiment_single 
> fab -H 192.168.1.2,192.168.1.3 check_host
> fab -l

See ./docs/TEACUP-System-v1.1.pdf for more details about TEACUP's architecture,
and setting up and running experiments.

See ./docs/TEACUP-Analysis-v1.1.pdf for more details about TEACUP's tools for
analysing the output of previous experiments.


INSTALL TRAFFIC GENERATOR TOOLS
-------------------------------

These are needed on the experiment hosts.

Install iperf, httperf and nttcp from the packages provided in ./tools
Refer to the documentation of each tool on how to install them.


INSTALL TCP LOGGERS
-------------------

These are needed on the experiment hosts. Which tools are needed depends on the OS(s)
installed on the experiment hosts.

Linux
-----

On Linux we now have two options -- using web10g (polling) or ttprobe (event-driven)

(a) Install web10g by downloading web10g from http://www.web10g.org/ and
following the instructions provided to install a patched Linux kernel and the web10g
userland tools. If you use web10g version 2.0.8 or higher nothing else is required. If
you use web10g version 2.0.7 you must patch the userland code with the patch provided
in the TEACUP tarball (web10g-logger-0.1-web10g-2.0.7.patch) and then compile and install
the userland code.  

You must use web10g version 2.0.7 or newer, TEACUP does not work with older web10g 
versions.

(b) Install ttprobe by following the instructions in tools/ttprobe-0.1.2.tgz

FreeBSD
-------

You must use FreeBSD 8.2 or newer, where SIFTR is part of the kernel. You must patch the 
SIFTR kernel module with the patch provided in the TEACUP tarball 
(freebsd_siftr_ertt_patch.tar.gz), rebuild and install it. Instructions on how to patch 
SIFTR are provided in the freebsd_siftr_ertt_patch.tar.gz tarball.

Windows 7
---------

Install the Windows TCP EStats Logger provided in the TEACUP tarball 
(win-estats-logger-0.1.zip). Follow the instructions provided in the README file 
inside the zip archive.

Mac OS X
--------

Install the SIFTR-like logger for Mac OS X provided in the TEACUP tarball 
(dsiftr-osx-0.1.zip). Follow the instructions in the README file inside the zip archive.

INTRODUCTION
------------

This README is for TEACUP Version 1.1

This README provides a brief overview on where to find information on setting
up a TEACUP testbed, running experiments and analysing the results of experiments.

The project website is https://sourceforge.net/projects/teacup


TEACUP TESTBED
--------------

TEACUP makes some assumptions on the setup of the testbed and hosts. In order
to use all of TEACUP's functions one needs to install a testbed similar to the
one described briefly in INSTALL and described in more detail in:
http://caia.swin.edu.au/reports/150210C/CAIA-TR-150210C.pdf

A minimum setup for TEACUP does not require all the functionality
described in CAIA-TR-150210C.pdf. The minimum setup is:
- Two subnets separated by one router, with at least one host in each
  subnet acting as traffic source/sink;
- Hosts must run Linux, FreeBSD, Windows 7 or Mac OS X, the router must run
  Linux (preferably) or FreeBSD;
- Each host needs an extra network interface connected to a separate control 
  network;
- A control host that runs TEACUP to control the testbed via the control
  network;
- TCP logging tools for OS must be installed as explained in CAIA-TR-150210C.pdf;
- Traffic generators must be installed as explained in CAIA-TR-150210C.pdf;
- Support tools must be installed as explained in CAIA-TR-150210C.pdf, but
  depending on the OS many of these are already installed by default.

A multi-boot OS setup with PXE booting and power controllers as decribed in
CAIA-TR-150210C.pdf is very useful but optional.
